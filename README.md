CSE 345 Database Design and Implementation Project

Requirement:
This site provides its current students a convenient way to check the schedule for classes and upcoming events. 
The students can also update their contact information through the site. 

First, a student needs to sign-up an account, by providing personal information (e.g., name, date of birth, address, phone number, email, etc.) and current status -level (beginner, intermediate or advanced) and belt (white, yellow, or etc.). 
After logged in, the student can view all classes for his level and upcoming test events for his classes. 

Class information includes class name (e.g., Songahm 1, Fighting Fans), age group (e.g., ages 4-7, adult), one instructor (e.g., Master Jess), time (e.g., 5-5:45 PM, Monday).  
A class teaches either a form[1] (move) or a weapon[2]. Same classes can be scheduled multiple times a week, taught by same or different instructors. 
An instructor can teach multiple classes. 
Weapon classes should be age appropriate, for instance, Fighting Fan is for all ages, but Swords for 13 or older. 

A test event indicates the testing type (e.g., Songahm 1) corresponding to a class name, and testing time (e.g., 10AM, April 1st ).
